# Overview
The SRS is an official report that acts as a software representation, enabling clients to determine whether the report (SRS) fits their demands. It also contains detailed explanations of the system requirements as well as the system's user requirements. Here our project online grocery store application helps consumers to get easy access to their daily basic needs. The main goal of creating a grocery app in connection with a grocery store is to offer a customer loyalty program that will help to keep the current customers and draw in new ones.
# Software Requirements
The software requirements stage involves the creation of Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) (also called a requirements document). This report, which lays the foundation for efforts in software engineering, is created after all requirements have been elicited and analyzed.
