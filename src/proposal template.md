## Introduction
This project is a online grocessary store application which helps consumers to get eassy access to their baily basic needs. Grocery mobile applications include an admin panel that we may access right away from our computer or smartphone. And also can control the complete inventory with the aid of the admin panel. The main goal of creating a grocery app in connection with a grocery store is to offer a customer loyalty program that will help to keep the current customers and draw in new ones. Offering a tailored and incredibly straightforward user experience is one of the most important methods to increase loyalty. Here in this project we are going to create a grocessary application for grocessary store which is in grand rapids that is spice of india, the main aim of this application is to provide the customers an easy and quick access to the items as spice of india store does not have an online application and most of the customers who travel so far find it difficult to grab the products from the store, through our application we can avoid extra miles on the automobiles, as well as save money on gas and parking, by opting to purchase online for delivery.)

# Anticipated Problems
* Participatio
  - In order to understand why a team member is not contributing, we would first interact with that person. If there are any personal concerns that are preventing us from working on the project, we would endeavor to find out about them. As a team, we would make sure that everyone had the necessary support and direction to finish the project effectively, and we would provide them the aid through weekly meetings.
* Communication
  - We use Zoom Meeting to interact with our team members, and Google Chat is used to provide Zoom Meeting links. We frequently hold online interactions using Google Chat. We communicate via Zoom sessions twice a week to discuss the tasks at hand as well as the progress and difficulties that our team members are experiencing so that we can collaborate to find answers.
* Decisions
  - We will have a group discussion to choose which team member wants to handle the paper writing, case study, and presentation parts before determining who will do what. After then, divide up the work among the team members, and we'll be sure to support one another as we go. We strive to properly comprehend what we are trying to determine as a group so that we have a purpose for conversations.
* Conflicts
  - Finding a point of agreement among all parties on a certain subject would be the first step in handling disagreements and disputes. Every team member has their own viewpoints and ideas, therefore when we work as a team, we make sure to solicit everyone's input before moving forward with the final result.
